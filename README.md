## Acknowledgements

The News API is the great resource supplying this news app. (https://newsapi.org/)

Thanks to Google and Udacity for the opportunity to learn so much in so little time. I actually was excited to code this app for the course. I want to learn and code more!

A huge "thank you" to Heather. As a social media authority, she is an excellent resource for me to get ideas and feedback on my apps!
